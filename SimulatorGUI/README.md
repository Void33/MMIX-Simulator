MMix Simulator GUI
==================

The graphical user interface component for this project requires the Scala language. Check out http://www.scala-lang.org/index.html to find out how to install Scala on your computer. The version of scala we used to develop this application is 2.11.6.

This component uses the scala build tool (SBT) as a release management tool. Check out http://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html to find out how to install SBT on your component. We used version 0.13.7 of the SBT launcher.

To execute this component all you need to do is execute "sbt run" in the current folder.

It should be noted that the Virtual Machine component needs to be running for this component to work fully.
